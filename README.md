Supermarket Chain Profit Optimization Project

Project Description

ðŸ‘‰ In this Excel project, I analyzed the data of a supermarket chain and explored ways to increase the companyâ€™s profit. I began by making corrections and performing calculations on the dataset.

ðŸ‘‰ Subsequently, I designed a dashboard using Pivot Tables, Timelines, and Slicers, ensuring that the chart types I selected were appropriate for the dataset.

ðŸ‘‰ Feel free to explore the details and analyses included in the files. Letâ€™s take a look together!
